# Alasdair_Thesis

This repository contains the work for my thesis on controlling Baxter with Barrett and Robotiq grippers, using ROS and MoveIt for motion planning, simulation, and joint accuracy evaluation.

## Directory Structure

- **setup**: Contains setup information, notes, and graphs related to the project.
  - `setup.txt`: Step-by-step instructions on how to run the code and execute the setup.
  - `notes.txt`: My personal notes during the project, including considerations for URDF and configuration changes.
  - `urdf_graphs`: Updated URDF diagrams and visual representations of the robotic setup.
  - `joint_accuracy_program`: The program used to gather joint accuracy readings.

- **ws_AF**: This is my ROS workspace. Most of the ROS packages, including Baxter, Barrett, and Robotiq grippers, are located here.
  - `baxter.sh`: A script that is used to communicate with the Baxter robot.
  - `csv`: CSV files generated by `joint_recorder.py`, containing joint data used for analysis.

- **src**: Contains all ROS source code.
  - `moveit_robots/baxter/baxter_moveit_config`: Stores the updated SRDF and configuration parameters for Baxter to work in MoveIt.
  - `baxter_common`: Includes additional visualization files for the grippers and an updated `baxter.urdf`.
  - `baxter`: Contains the `barrett-ros-pkg` for controlling the Barrett Hand and also the scenes for the MoveIt environment.
  - `Robotiq-2f-85-main`: ROS control package for the Robotiq gripper.
  - Other directories: Mostly default Baxter package files.

## Setup

The **setup** folder includes all the necessary instructions to get the environment up and running.

1. **Setup.txt**: Follow the instructions here to configure the workspace and launch the robot.
2. **Notes.txt**: My project notes and some key considerations are found here.

## ROS Workspace (ws_AF)

This is the primary workspace used in this project:

- `baxter.sh`: Use this script to establish communication with the Baxter robot, configuring necessary environment variables and ROS nodes.
- **CSV Files**: Generated from `joint_recorder.py`, these CSV files contain joint data which can be analyzed for joint accuracy and performance.

## MoveIt Configuration

The **MoveIt** setup for Baxter can be found in the `src/moveit_robots/baxter/baxter_moveit_config` directory.

### Key Changes:
- **SRDF**: Updated to include support for both the Barrett Hand and Robotiq Gripper.
- **Other Parameters**: These include joint limits, end-effectors, and planning configurations necessary for motion planning.

## Gripper Control

- **Barrett Hand**: Control for the Barrett hand is managed using the `barrett-ros-pkg` found under `src/baxter/barrett-ros-pkg`.
- **Robotiq Gripper**: The Robotiq 2F-85 Gripper ROS control package is under `src/Robotiq-2f-85-main`. This package integrates the Robotiq gripper into Baxter's control system.

## How to Run
